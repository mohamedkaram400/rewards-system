# 🎁 Reward System

A scalable Laravel-based platform that allows users to purchase credit packages, earn bonus points, and redeem them for exclusive products in the Offer Pool. Admins can fully manage the system via API.

---

# 💡 Business Requirements Understanding:
The goal is to build a robust credit/reward system where users can:

Purchase credit packages (that include bonus points)

Redeem points for special products

Be rewarded for their activity

Admins need full control to manage packages, products, and monitor transactions. The system should be modular and scalable, allowing easy integration with payment gateways like Paymob, and supporting AI-powered product recommendations in the future.

---

# 🌟 Feature Suggestion
AI-Powered Product Recommendations: Use OpenAI to suggest products based on user points and history. This adds a smart layer to improve user engagement and satisfaction.

---

# ✨ Features
**User Authentication**: Register/login/logout via API using Laravel Sanctum.

**Credit Packages**: Users can browse and purchase packages that include credits and bonus points.

**Point Transactions**: All point changes (purchase, redemption) are logged with type and related IDs.

**Product Redemption**: Users can use points to redeem products from the Offer Pool.

**Admin Management**:

Create/update/delete packages and products

Toggle product offer status

**Search & Filter**:

Search products by name, description, category

Filter by category or Offer Pool

**Redis Caching** Speeds up product listing with custom cache keys.

**Payment Gateway Integration**:

Strategy Pattern used to integrate Paymob (or other gateways in future)

Support for mock or real transactions

**(Bonus) AI Recommendations**:

**Uses OpenAI API** to suggest a product based on point balance and preferences
